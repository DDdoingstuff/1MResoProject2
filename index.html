		<h2>Create 1 Web Page per Day</h2>
		<img class="blog-photos" src="webpage.png" alt="web page layout">
		<p class="text">Through out the month of August I'm going to create a single webpage per day by tutorial instructions, creative visual ideas that come to me, or maybe by recreating web pages from previous clients that were designed on Wix or Wordpress. I think it's important for me to set small goals like this while learning so I come across a variety of visual layouts to research and execute as I go.</p>

		<h2>Spend at least 30min per day on MIMO App</h2>
		<img class="blog-photos" src="mimo.png" alt="Mimo App You Can Code Too">
		<p class="text"><a href="https://getmimo.com" target="_blank">MIMO</a> has been a great tool for me to use as a complete beginner to coding. I think it might be for 4 year olds, but it actually has been super encouraging since the app tracks your streaks and places you on a competitive board, which has motivated me to stay in first place every week since I started using it about 3 weeks ago. </p>

		<h2>Create a Visual Animation on the Weekends</h2>
		<img class="blog-photos" src="visualanimate.gif" alt="Visual Design Spapes Animation by Rodrigo Tello">
		<p class="text">To continue growing as a visual and motion graphic artist I will find an interesting animation loop, learn new techniques, and recreate as a fun project once per weekend.  </p>
